In inner classes ( anonymous inner class  too ) .class  file is generated lekin lamdas expression work differently .class file is not generated

Anonymous class is more powerful then lamdas but readability and coding is easier in lamdas.










Collections meh T super String esa khi nhi chalega ( class level support nhi karta )
? extends super esa chalta h 





default and abstract combination is not allowed

no keyword for default modifier
